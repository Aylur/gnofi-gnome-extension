# Gnofi IPC Examples

One of the reasons I made this extension is so that I have a reason to write
scripts in [nushell](https://www.nushell.sh/). These examples should be simple
enough to be readable without knowing anything about the language and should be
simple enough to rewrite in your preferred language.

Contributing examples are welcome! I generally don't recommend using bash and
compiled languages, but they are still welcome.
